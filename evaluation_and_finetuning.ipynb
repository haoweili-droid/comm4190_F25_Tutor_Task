    "### 🔹 3. Too Much Tension  \n",

    "    In this session, I felt more guided and supported by the tutor. The tutor asked about my reason for wanting to learn guitar, which reaffirmed me and gave me more motivations to learn. \n",

    "\n",

    "    This showed the language used to guide users to understand their motivation and goal in learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "> If you’ve never played guitar before, what’s your guess: what fingers do you think are most commonly used in fingerstyle, and how might they each be assigned to different strings?\n",
    "> What did you notice about your fingers when doing the tabletop practice? Were some fingers easier to move independently than others?\n",

    "    These questions were given back to back to me as a student, which made me felt frustrated. These can be tiring for me as a beginner who doesn't know a lot becuase I had to guess the answer every time, and it gave me the sense of frustration and struggling too frequently that even hindered my learning. Questions also made me feel that the tutoring session was disorganized and the content depended solely on my answer rather than the knowlede of the tutor, though the conversations built on one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this session, the tutor was a little less likely to get distracted than in the unstructured tutoring session. When I sarted to introduce distracting topics, it gave two rounds of conversations that were still related to the main learning topic. For example, using more interactive sentence filling game:\n",
    "\n",

    ">👉 “Fingerstyle guitar is a way of playing guitar where instead of using a pick to strum chords, I use _______________ to ___________.”\n",

    ">GOAL: This is a tutoring exercise in which you play the role of AI tutor and you will help a student learn more about a topic of their choice. Your goal is to improve understanding and to challenge students to construct their own knowledge via open ended questions, hints, tailored explanations, and examples. <span style=\"color: purple;\">As a tutor, you should also guide and motivate students to learn the task they intended to study. You should scaffold self-regulated learning by letting the students know if they are on track to their goal. This means that if students get distracted, you should quickly monitor and return nudges, prompts, or even intervention to help them focus on the goal and continue to learn. This depends on students’ goal for the session, so you should clarify the goal of the single session and target your guidance based on their intended pace. You should refrain from talking unrelated topics with students for too long that distract them. </span>\n",

The tutor then guides and supports the student and helps them learn about the topic. The tutor only wraps up the conversation once the student shows <span style=\"color: purple;\"> evidence of the main goal set for the session (either it’s </span> the student can explain something in their own words, can connect an example to a concept, or can apply a concept given a new situation or problem.), <span style=\"color: purple;\"> or when the student shows extreme frustration and mental health issues or other conditions that will hinder their learning and wellbeing: </span>\n",

I have another question for you to help me help you: What is your learning level…”.  This part of the conversations works best when you and the student take turns asking and answering questions instead of you asking a series of questions all at once.
